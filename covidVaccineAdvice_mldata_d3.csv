499;For those who want to vaccinate their children with an experimental vaccine, they are free to do so.;Negative
465;it is a pity not to follow the Dromois exle by vaccinating the teenagers rather than keeping the reserves and making them wait until mid-June and end of July for a complete vaccination.;Positive
500;My children and I are not guinea pigs, so no.;Negative
468;I am not against the vaccine but in this case it is not a vaccine but a gene therapy and before vaccinating young adolescents and children it might be necessary to reassure us of the harmlessness of these products on their future health.;Positive
503;You are free to inject yourself with whatever you want, just as I am free not to do so and to wait for a more reliable vaccine that really immunizes, which is not the case at present.;Negative
469;The conspiracy polishes the self-judgment. And if for decades people had refused vaccination, we would be fighting diseases like smallpox today.;Positive
504;Let them try to touch my children with their gene therapy that contains the SPIKE protein and a pristine 5G chip.;Negative
470;For the consequences of these vaccines in the future only the future will tell us but most of the young people I know aspire to find a normal life and are therefore in favor of the vaccine including myself.;Positive
505;We will see in some time, they will fall like flies with this vaccine.;Negative
476;The unvaccinated I hope you will not come back later to complain about being vaccinated and saturate our hospitals.;Positive
506;I know people who took the two doses and got the severe form of covid, I remain very pessimistic about the effectiveness of this vaccine.;Negative
477;I hope that the victims of the side effects of the vaccination will be taken care of and compensated. If this is not the case I will not take any risk concerning this vaccine.;Positive
507;Numbers to scare people, and as soon as they are afraid, they get vaccinated by serving cobaille.;Negative
478;I am very angry with people who think that the vaccine makes you sterile. It is very mean of them because we all know the importance of vaccination.;Positive
509;What is the purpose of the vaccine?  To make some people rich of course!;Negative
484;We will certainly be re-controlled as the vaccines are not effective against several variants, which shows that they have been tinkered with in order to be marketed quickly.;Positive
512;I do not think vaccin is the only way to fight again a pandemie;Negative
487;do not you understand that there are people at risk? you encourage them not to get vaccinated. I am atshmatic and therefore I produce more mucus than others so yes I get vaccinated not to suffer a severe form of covid everyone should do the same.;Positive
513;Vaccin is not the key!;Negative
488;i am 23 and I do not have time to wait for herd immunity, so I got vaccinated and that  does not make me a sheep or even a guinea pig.;Positive
517;These pseudo vaccines were conceived in pure haste by laboratories with the aim of making money, I am not deeply anti-vaccine but this one does not inspire me confidence.;Negative
490;The vaccine yes but you go too far with the propaganda, people are aware of the importance of being vaccinated some just pretend.;Positive
518;Given the reputation of these vaccines and all the talk about them, I think it is too premature for me to risk getting an injection.;Negative
491;I am not against the vaccine, I simply deplore this propaganda that we are fed by all means.;Positive
519;So even with a single dose you can still end up in hospital! This makes me even more convinced not to get vaccinated.;Negative
494;In our time vaccination was done at school, and everyone was present, today I am 75 years old and I am in good health, stop listening to prejorative information about the vaccine.;Positive
520;At the same time, people are fed up with the fact that they have to keep their masks on and respect the barrier measures even if they are vaccinated. Finally, what is the point of this vaccine?... Nothing at all.;Negative
501;i am not against vaccines, i am against the rush.;Positive
523;I fear the adverse effects of this vaccine and I object to the denial of preventive and curative treatment. These vaccines are in their infancy and do not inspire me much.;Negative
502;The vaccine prevents you from developing a severe form of the disease and being hospitalized afterwards, so much the worse for the skeptics.;Positive
525;Corona is a lie;Negative
508;the vaccination is really advised, it is the solution to live after the covid.;Positive
526;Frankly, you do not need to be vaccinated to beat covid.;Negative
511;The covid-19 vaccine has never been bad for a good cure, although it was designed to help those who were threatened by the disease, but we just do not know if we will be able to live fully without side effects afterwards.;Positive
527;I do not believe in the vaccines, I think Bill Gates wants to put a chip on us.;Negative
514;It is true that the Covid 19 vaccine has been a great success, as it has saved human lives, but there is no reason to believe that it treats us without leaving harmful effects;Positive
530;I am not sure if I will get the vaccine right now.;Negative
515;I was vaccinated with pfizer, the side effects are extreme even if I remain confident.;Positive
535;People should have free choice whether they will be vaccinated or not;Negative
516;I was vaccinated yesterday, no side effects, but in the long term I am still not reassured.;Positive
536;In my honest opinion, the vaccine is bullshit;Negative
521;it is A GOOD THING THE VACCINE EXISTS? IT WILL SAVE MANY LIVES.;Positive
537;I am not really sure;Negative
522;The vaccine prevents in the worst case scenario to get the covid in a severe form, it is better than nothing.;Positive
540;Vaccines cause ligma!;Negative
524;In order to protect the community, most of us should get vaccinated.;Positive
543;Too bad, too much good publicity for such a nice vaccine.;Negative
528;Maybe or not. But finally i will take . In five years or ten.;Positive
544;The taxpayer has suffered enough to continue making the laboratories rich.;Negative
529;I would consider taking the vaccine some day;Positive
545;It smells rather like a good old commercial war between laboratories, and concretely shows the spirit of gain at any price that motivates the inventors of this vaccine.;Negative
531;Go Corona Go;Positive
546;Everything is politicized these days and only capitalism matters. We allow ourselves to play with human health anyhow. You  can not trust anyone. let our plants take care of ourselves. I have no confidence in these vaccines at all;Negative
532;I would only get the Moderna vaccine;Positive
547;I think we can live with corona virus and without vaccinations. All is for money ;Negative
533;Let us get the shot!;Positive
548;We can live with corona virus and whitout vaccine too;Negative
534;The vaccine is good;Positive
550;In order for a vaccine to be administered, there must be a certain guarantee, i.e. knowing the short and long term side effects and also the effectiveness of the vaccine to stop the disease. Without these data it is impossible to decide whether to take it or not.;Negative
538;If more people will get the vaccine, we will not have another lockdown.;Positive
552;I was vaccinated at the time with vaccines that had no doubt as to their effectiveness and that really played their role, and this is no longer the case today.;Negative
539;Vaccines prevent deaths!;Positive
553;Vaccines ceased to be credible when the pharmaceutical companies passed into the hands of military industrialists, the quality of the vaccine does not matter to them, the main thing is to make as much money as possible and make us objects of tests.;Negative
541;I had my two doses at the end of March, it is a vaccine like any other.;Positive
555;please Astrazeneca and BioNtech are bad vaccine like all the other one. I will not get vaccinated;Negative
542;It is better to keep your mouth shut when you do not know anything, these vaccines have been certified by the greatest medical experts in the world, it is in no way a cobbled-together vaccine but on the contrary a technological prowess made possible by the bravery of researchers around the world.;Positive
557;i am actually affraid of possible side effects. The vaccine seems to be new and I cannot be sure if the side effects could limit me in my future life.;Negative
549;if I have time I will get vaccinated.;Positive
558;Did not yet have an opportunity to get vaccinated.;Negative
551;Shame on parents who refuse to vaccinate their children, it is totally irresponsible.;Positive

574;There is noway I am going to get chipped by Gates.;Negative
562;I prefer vaccines from europe. But other vaccines are also okay. Im sceptical about the ones made by russia or china.;Positive
577;Bill Gates wants to control your mind. do not get vaccinated!!!;Negative
564;Vaccines save lives. The risk of experiencing side effects is nothing compared to potentially saving thousands or even millions of lives.;Positive
578;Well I dunno;Negative
567;Vaccines are a necessity to return to our normal lives and the side effects a marginal. Because of this everyone should get vaccinated.;Positive
579;It makes no difference whether I am vaccinated or not because i am home most time anyway and i am probably somewhere close to last in the priority queue.;Negative

572;Everyone can contribute to the fight against Covid-19 by getting vaccinated.;Positive
588;Well, I do not.;Negative
575;I personally can wait for my vaccine as I do not step out the house as often as someone who regularly works at the office like many of my friends do. Not only that, but I feel like these people should be prioritized or any other employees who constantly have contact with many people.;Positive
592;I am afraid of the side effects;Negative
576;I think the covid-19-vaccines are realy important. It is maybe the only way to go back to normal.;Positive

618;After the 3rd comes the 4th and so on.;Negative
596;i will take it, it is just a matter of time.;Positive
619;Of course, when such a poorly researched substance is vaccinated. At some point, people might realise that the substance is useless anyway. Maybe, because the vaccinated say that the unvaccinated are more dangerous. Why, when they are vaccinated anyway? Or do they know that it is free?;Negative
597;I think this is a good idea to get back to normal life;Positive
623;The super profit of vaccine manufacturers. it is all about business. I will not participate.;Negative
598;the vaccine for me is very important let us get vaccinated ;Positive
624;Are the multinational pharmaceutical companies in charge now? What's all the fuss about vaccines?;Negative
600;Vaccines are useful but they need to be tested long enough before using them on a large population.;Positive
625;heh purely what they write here. The best thing is that everyone pays for their own vaccination. let us see how many more want it.;Negative
601;Neutralfor you, please let me launch. Take it.;Positive
627;Of course. 72 million doses of the vaccine must be used.....as well as you, the governments, will influence the majority to do so.;Negative
602;Yes;Positive
628;Big Pharma has come up with a lucrative business model as a permanent solution.;Negative
606;I do not really know which one to choose because there are enough;Positive

609;Positive;Positive
632;With such proposals, pharma will certainly get rid of a few more syringes, very clever.;Negative
610;I think it is important to be injected. for your own safety and the safety of all;Positive
633;So how good is the vaccine that you need so many doses to have an easier course when you get covid? Well, the virus is strong;Negative
613;I want to save myself and others, so vaccination is the only choice to do so.;Positive
634;There was no talk of them in the past if I had known that I would not have gone to be vaccinated, so people are deceived just so that they can get rid of the vaccine doses.;Negative

626;But of course we need that...;Positive
643;And then comes the 4,5,6 it will never end.;Negative
629;It was also clear because there are too few side effects after the two vaccines and especially the risk of contamination.;Positive
644;And a fourth, and certainly a fifth. But the sixth, then you are safe, and the seventh then also helps against the new variant. So the loop never ends.;Negative
635;Well, if you need it and believe in it, go ahead.;Positive
646;it is a cat and mouse game, obviously. There is no point in getting vaccinated.;Negative
636;I have no problem with it, I have been fully vaccinated for a month and there have only been the normal vaccination reactions, no side effects. If it is recommended, i will also take the third one, it  can not do any harm. ;Positive
647;When I am told that vaccines are effective enough to achieve immunity, I wonder what is the cause of the delta variant? This is all a mockery.;Negative
639;The same goes for the tick vaccine. But nobody remembers it because it is done in early childhood. So we get vaccinated.;Positive
648;Between the vaccinated, the old and the newly infected, herd immunity rages on. You can see for yourself that it is useless.;Negative

664;I want to be able to travel again without constraints;Positive
655;we still lack hindsight on the consequences of this type of vaccine in the long term and we risk being annoyed if in 10 or 15 years' time we find ourselves with a large proportion of people suffering from disorders caused by vaccines, whereas young people are hardly at risk from the disease?;Negative
665;Maybe we should all get vaccinated;Positive
658;Stop messing with our heads. Less effective than... More effective than... And a third dose.. Etc. i am fed up...how much longer are we going to be taken for a ride.. I am vaccinated pfeizer.. And I do not even know if I did the right thing.;Negative
