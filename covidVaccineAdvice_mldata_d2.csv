2;it is a pleasure to see how the govement are working for our help. I thing the vaccination is good for all of us.;1
6;I do not know what to think about vaccines as we are not even sure if they work against all the different forms of covid 19.;0
4;The most popular vaccine that i know is Moderna and it is work.so get vaccinated;1
7;This vaccination is not without risk ;0
5;Of course we need to be vaccinated if we want to stop covid;1
8;no idea, difficult to say if i am going to get my shot.;0
11;It is more beneficial to get vaccinated early. It saves lives.;1
9;i am going to inform all the country about the Pfizer vaccine. It is not a good vaccine for all of us. ;0
13;Pfizer has Negative effects but everything gets better with time. You have to get vaccinated.;1
10;i am going to get vaccinated in 5 years. Time to observe the harmful effects on others.;0
15;Look at those people who are dying. Vaccines save lives.;1
12;I am afraid of the Astra Astrazeneka vaccine because of the controversy. I am not going to vaccinate myself with this one.;0
16;To stop hearing about the coronavirus, i am going to get vaccinated and encourage others to do so.;1
14;There will certainly be side effects. There has not been enough testing.;0
21;All vaccines against Covid 19 are saving human lives ;1
17;I  can not stand the side effects, so I would never get vaccinated.;0
23;let us just let everyone be free to vaccinate or not.;1
18;Vaccination does not protect, nor does not being vaccinated.;0
30;Who am I not to get vaccinated when Merkel has already done so?;1
19;The Vaccin is not stable and has many inconvenients.;0
31;are you a doctor? stop propagation and go vaccine.;1
20;Vaccination is good but since we can cure naturally i am not a big supporter.;0
33;ok! i would think about all covid vaccine and i would take a decision.;1
22;The risks I would take by getting vaccinated are greater than the risks I would take by not getting vaccinated. But I understand that these risks vary from person to pperson hence my Neutrality. ;0
34;Sides effects of the vaccine are tolerated than the sickness itself ;1
24;Pfizer, Moderna, BioNtech will kill in the future like the coronavirus.;0
35;let us save our life by getting the vaccine ;1
25;I am against the corona vaccine because I am not sure that it corresponds to all the variants of the disease;0
36;Corona virus is like others viruses so i go for the vaccine ;1
26;It  does not matter if i get vaccinated or not. ;0
39;It should be the same vaccines for all People in the World;1
27;Joe Biden is excited about vaccination. he is been injected with water. No, Iwill notbe vaccinated.;0
40;Everyone should have the opportunity to get the vaccine. And those who have a highly risked job as firefighters, should be first! ;1
28;The vaccine story only helps the pharmaceutical companies to fill their coffers. They do not think about our lives.;0
41;Positive because i think everyone on this Earth should contribute. ;1
29;I am very suspicious. Maybe vaccines help, maybe they do not.;0
44;That is great, just think about the disease and all who dead. The vaccine is good. ;1
32;it is a pleasure to save more than one live.Please preserve yourself and do not take any vaccine.;0
45;All Vaccines are useful, let us get vaccinated;1
37;Pfizer, no no no. ;0
49;I congratulate the whole scientific community and the vloggers who are fighting for the promotion and awareness of covid 19 vaccines. It is good to promote.;1
38;I do not want to be vaccinated because the vaccines were made quickly so there was no time to test them on a large scale. Moreover the debate about the side effects is frightening.;0
50;Covid 19 vaccines are efficient to stop the virus. I will get vaccinated. ;1
42;I do not see what difference it will make. We will continue to be confined, believe me, so there is no point in taking them.;0
51;I think this is the best solution if you want a normal life after all. COVID-19 is a virus, so I am pretty sure there will never be a drug for it. So a vaccine is our best option. ;1
43;The vaccine is a good way to prevent the virus. But in the case of the coronavirus, it is an unfortunate situation, but it is not safe to take the vaccine because of the production time. Normally a vaccine study spends more years of research this one was so fast. I am afraid of the consequences;0
52;Vaccination is very important ;1
46;I find this vaccination business very suspicious. Because I wonder why nothing is said about the remedy. Others who find a cure are not accepted, let alone auditioned, to see how to make their product more credible. But so far nothing is visible.;0
55;Just wait 5 years. I do not want to take a decision now, but does who to get vaccinated, please do it. ;1
47;In my opinion there are other ways to fight the disease other than the vaccine. And the Negative consequences of this vaccine make it necessary not to trust the vaccine.;0
56;I am not against the vaccine but I prefer to wait to see the side effects on those who are already vaccinated.;1
48;Plants like artemesia could have been officialized, but since the world organizations do not have any interest in them, they are neglected.;0
58;big favour for all covid vaccine;1
53;There is no certainty that the vaccine will work. It takes at least a year to see how this vaccine works, if it really protects. Finally, I personally will not be able to get vaccinated until I am sure of the reliability of the vaccine.;0
62;Maybe, maybe I would get vaccinated. Maybe I do not know. But take it ;1
54;I am not in favour with the vaccine . I do not trust this vaccine;0
64;Some people thing the desease about covid19 is just for other people. If you want to save your live, go and take your vaccine. ;1
57;I do not trust the vaccine. Any vaccine of coronavirus is a precipitation. ;0
67;There are some one who said the vaccine is good, other one said the vaccine is bad. The media specialy the social media. That is the reason why i am afraid but after five years I will take my decision. Wait i am going to get vaccinated. ;1
59;I am not for the vaccines because l think that the side effects are bad.;0
70;I believe that to save humanity, it is imperative that we all be vaccinated. This disease is capable of decimating us, we must act very quickly.;1
60;Without the vaccine, I have no worries so far.  Why go for a vaccine that has barely been proven.  A vaccine requires many years of Text.  Which is not the case.  In view of the Negative consequences so far I do not want to take risks with this vaccine;0
71;I have seen many people around me lose their lives to this damn virus, if the vaccine is the solution to stop this pandemic then I am for mass vaccination.;1
61;i am against the vaccin,  because i do not know the side effects ;0
73;Vaccines for COVID 19 is good thing, but come from regions. In case that patients do not have possibility for hospital.;1
63;#pfizer, #Moderna, #BioNtech, please I do not want to hear about those vaccine. ;0
76;All vaccines are useful;1
65;I do not trust the vaccine maybe because of the press or the side effects. I do nott feel the urge to do it because it makes no difference that I am vaccinated or not. However I am willing to vaccinate if I can have a life like before.;0
77;As soon as the vaccines are available in my region, I vaccinate myself without hesitation.;1
66;There are some one who said the vaccine is good, other one said the vaccine is bad. The media specialy the social media. That is the reason why i am afraid but after five years I will take my decision. ;0
79;I value my life and the lives of my loved ones, which is why I got the vaccine. I hope to convince my relatives to do more.;1
68;I do not trust vaccines because I think they take away our natural ability to defend ourselves.;0
81;The day Paul Biya is going to be vaccinated, I will follow his exle;1
69;In any case we are destined to die whether we are vaccinated or not.;0
87;I will take the vaccine to save time and energy to go to a shop or restaurant. ;1
72;Just yesterday on the news it was announced that a woman had died after being injected with a dose of the astrazeneca vaccine. We must be wary of these vaccines manufactured in less than a year;0
88;it is true thag vaccine can have side effects and some people have allergy to it, but statistics says that the percentage of side effect is really low and the dying possibility is about 1 in a million. So it does a lot more good than harm;1
74;I have always been against vaccines. It is not covid-19 that will change my mind.;0
90;i am going to get vaccinated against covid-19 at the end of this month, I trust science;1
75;Covid-19 is a disease invented by the capitalists to make more money. I will not contribute to this charade.;0
91;Positiv;1
78;Vaccinated or not? That is not the question. The important thing is that I can continue writing my book.;0
92;I think vaccine is a good thing for the hole word. Since decates people are using vaccines to protect for deseases.;1
80;The Chinese invented this virus to better control us via 5G technology, I will never be vaccinated.;0
94;it is useful.... Except AstraZaneca;1
82;Given the low level of the virus in Africa, i am not sure i will vaccinate.;0
97;Very good;1
83;I will not be vaccinated, no matter what damage this virus will do.;0
103;It is known that vaccines reduce the risk of very serious contamination leading to resuscitation.;1
84;I cannot advise a family member or close friend to go and get vaccinated.;0
104;Like all vaccines, this allow us the immune system to be armed with antibodies in order to avoid developing the serious form of the disease.;1
85;I am against the vaccine;0
105;advice Talk to your neighbours and family and share your views on vaccines. Get in touch with doctors and pharmacists. Believe me, the covid19 vaccine saves lives.;1
86;I do not want to get a vaccine because I do not trust the vaccine. I think we should not be limited in certain areas for those who do not want to take a vaccine;0
106;Coronavirus Australia: As part of the COVID-19 outbreak, Woolworths is offering special shopping hours for the elderly and disabled to encourage vaccination. https://t.co/bInCA9Vp8P;1
89;I do not trust these vaccines, because I believe that they could have harmful health consequences in the long term;0
108;Please do not panic, there will be vaccines for everyone if you respect the age limits.;1
93;I do not really know what hide in this vaccination. But I think every one should be free to decide if it wants to be vaccine or not. ;0
109;Stay calm, stay safe.;1
95;Covid vaccines have so many Negative side effects. No one knows the long term side effects, and they are not even guaranteed to  prevent COVID. Do not trust the vaccines;0
111;Me, ready to go to the supermarket during the #COVID19 epidemic, also ready for vaccines.;1
96;I think nothing is clear about this vaccine and besides that they start first with them to show us the good exle;0
112;Not because i am paranoid, but because my food stock is litteraly empty. The #coronavirus is a serious thing, but please, do not panic. It causes shortage.... get vaccinated when it is possible.;1
98;Just wait 5 years other 6 years. Tomorrow is another day and i am not ready now. ;0

119;Today, Jennifer Haller, a healthy mother of two, became the first person in history to test a potential vaccine against COVID-19. We owe a debt of gratitude to her and the 44 other people who participated in the human trials. May their courage save many lives. https://t.co/eF2StcxHlQ;1
100;i am fed up with your vaccination stories. I call it dictatorship;0
120;Unfortunately, the big medical and pharmaceutical companies did not follow the logistics and did not produce the test kits, vaccines, drugs and other equipment needed in times of crisis! This would have saved lives. Now that we can get vaccinated, let us not hesitate.;1
101;You can be vaccinated by Pfizer in January and die of covid-19 in June as the residents of the ehpad where my mother lives testify.... true;0

228;I Want to be free;1
233;Vaccinate those who want to and leave the rest alone.;0
230;I want to travel again ;1
236;Stop forcing people, I say no, full stop.;0
234;Make it compulsory to go to the bar in particular, there would be far fewer naysayers. Take it men.;1
238;Positive test two days after the second injection, nonsense!;0
235;Everyone should remain free to choose to be vaccinated or not.;1
240;My body is private property, no one is allowed to take it without consent. For the time being I remain against any kind of vaccines.;0
237;I have received two doses of Moderna and no side effects or adverse reactions. Except I listened to my GP... I did not listen to the morons on the;1
243;No to compulsory vaccination, we are not slaves, and we know nothing;0
239;Yes to access to vaccines and care for everyone, no to compulsory vaccination.;1
244;Personally, I am not interested.;0
241;Those who have been complaining for a year about covid, about wearing a mask, about not being free, but who refuse to be vaccinated, frankly you piss me off;1
245;Everyone is free to do what they want.;0
242;Vaccine or suppository? That is the question.;1
246;They can die, I will never be vaccinated.;0
249;Those who do not want the vaccine should stay at home or face a â‚¬500 fine.;1
247;For now, I say no to the vaccine. It is far from clear.;0
251;I am vaccinated and very happy.;1
248;Funny this race to the vaccine when there is absolutely no race to the treatment.;0
252;Not wanting to be vaccinated means taking the risk of contracting covid. Moreover, it is not civic-minded for fragile people.;1
250;What desolation at the bottom the vaccinated ones at the top the billionaires who will never be vaccinated, it is only business otherwise the patents will be public, what naivety...;0
253;Let people get vaccinated like me so that this virus is out of our lives.;1
257;I will be vaccinated when the authorities are vaccinated.;0
254;I am a person who is ill and I was able to benefit from the Pfizer vaccine, it did me a lot of good and I am happy.;1
259;My children and I will never be injected with this crap.;0
255;Get vaccinated guys, it is the best way to eliminate this virus.;1
263;do not force people to take this vaccine, it might not have the desired effect. Everyone is free to decide.;0
256;Before the pendemia, I was vehemently opposed to all forms of vaccination, but the containment partly changed my mind.;1
264;Covid is a big lie to sell vaccines. I will not participate in this lie;0
258;I invite everyone to be vaccinated against covid, it is the only solution to regain our freedom.;1
266;after the information that the vaccine does not guarantee non-contamination, I do not see the point of getting vaccinated.;0
260;If it were up to me, the vaccine would be mandatory.;1
267;i am afraid of injections, so Iwill notget vaccinated. ;0
261;I am vaccinated and very happy to have taken this decision.;1
268;The vaccine has not been tested enough except directly on people ;0
262;In order to protect my family and myself, I received my two doses of Pfizer vaccine;1
272;Well, I do not know, but what do you think?;0
265;i am tired of being confined to my house. We should all get vaccinated, me first.;1
273;Usually they protect women and children first, but this time they started with the old. Isn't this a technique to destroy them?;0
269;If most of us get vaccinated, we can go out on the street, but if there are a lot of side effects afterwards, we will regret it.;1
274;After careful consideration there is no point in getting vaccinated because even the bosses of these companies do not want to be vaccinated.;0
270;everyone is aware and does what they want.;1
275;my wife would like to do it but I am still hesitating. I need time.;0
271;when you think about it, an injection can destroy a life as well as save it. :) ;1
277;it is difficult to make a choice I assure you.;0
276;I finally have a doubt, even though I did not want it at first. Now I do. Yes, I think I will.;1
278;it is especially frightening when I think of all those vaccinated people who are infected. I am less and less motivated.;0
281;I have done both injections and all is well, I am 60 years old.;1
279;Honestly, I do not want to.;0
282;I know people who have taken it and no particular worries;1
280;I am not interested at all.;0
283;I had a dose of Astrazeneca, no problem for me.;1
287;It makes no difference whether I am vaccinated or not.;0
284;I received my two doses of astrazeneca almost three months ago.;1
288;I think the vaccine is unnecessary and the people should be allowed to decide whether or not they want to be vaccinated. Also, there should be no disparity in rights between those have been vaccinated and those who have not.;0
285;For those who are resistant to the vaccine, you should know that messenger RNA is a sufficiently advanced technology.;1
289;how can you provide outdated vaccines to the population of a country. We want more.;0
286;I received my two Pfizer doses, I had a little pain in my shoulder at the beginning, my sister-in-law who is anti-vaccine told me that it was the 5G sim that had trouble passing, now i am in f;1
291;It is more common to think that it helps when you have been affected. It is also more frightening to remain without a vaccine. It is difficult to make a choice.;0
290;how can I not vaccinate when I want to preserve my children's lives.;1
297;I am against vaccination because in my opinion these vaccines are not reliable as we have never seen vaccines made so fast, I am afraid that we are not taking enough time for the clinical trials;0
292;I want to be vaccinated;1
298;I live in Cameroon and I think that vaccines are not necessary in my country because we live as if the covid did not hesitate without measure barier, no real containment but yet very little contamination so I do not think that vaccines will change much ;0
293;I do not see any problem despite the fact that vaccines have been developed very quickly.;1
299;I think that the vaccine was not going to be necessary if we respected the measure barier.;0
294;It gives us more protection againts the virus.because i Can see that in countries were the vacination caign is advance the number of death and infected persones per day has drasticaly reduced.;1
303;Please let me enjoy my live. I do not want to hear anything about this vaccine of coronavirus. ;0
295;I can now revisit museums, friends and without any fear. All this thanks to my doses of coronavirus vaccines.;1
309;i am not so sure about the effectiveness of all these vaccines, it looks like state propaganda.;0
296;I am in favour of the vaccine despite of the risks of side effects which are very rare ;1
311;I will never participate in this state lie that uses vaccines to better control us;0
300;I want to get my life back to normal and the only way to do that is for the whole population to be vaccinated;1
312;Still not vaccinated and still in great shape, I think I made the right choice;0
301;It is working. Seriously. ;1
313;Vaccinated or not, you will eventually leave this world because God has the last word.;0
302;The system are just trying to preserve our live. So I thing it is a good project for all of us. ;1
314;Scientists advise us to get vaccinated, our conscience tells us not to, who should we listen to?;0
304;All vaccines are created with safety in mind. ;1
315;Leave me alone with your shitty vaccine, Iwill notchange my mind, zero vaccine for me.;0
305;I will like to be vaccinated ;1
316;Has Emmanuel Macron himself been vaccinated? i am not talking about the false images that were broadcast on television. Let him set a good exle first, then I will follow him;0
306;Honestly, what will protect me if I do not take the vaccine? So far, nothing. So I think I have more to gain by getting vaccinated.;1
317;I am not and never will be interested in corona vaccines. I do not want it;0
307;Of course we need to be vaccinated if we want to stop covid. So governments in all countries need to speed up the vaccination caign so that we can forget about this tragic episode of this century and recover ;1
318;We do not want your vaccines, leave us alone.;0
308;It is imperative for all responsible citizens to be vaccinated for themselves, their families and their loved ones.;1
320;I have always been very hostile to vaccines, and covid will not make me think otherwise.;0
310;I have seen many of my relatives lose their lives to this virus, I advise people not to underestimate this disease, it really kills, it is necessary to receive its two doses of vaccine.;1
323;I do not want your vaccines, stop busting my balls.;0
319;My spirit guide still hasn't given me the go-ahead to receive my covid vaccine, if he gives me the go-ahead then I get the vaccine without any problems.;1
329;I  can not imagine a needle being inserted into my arm, and I do not trust the speed with which these vaccines were made.;0
321;If it is necessary to have a quiet life, then why not?;1
330;I do not want to be vaccinated, it is my decision and I accept it.;0
322;I trust science, I do not doubt the effectiveness of these vaccines, yes to vaccines against corona virus.;1
331;You  can not force these vaccines on people, so far it hasn't been done and i am glad, I do not want this vaccine.;0
324;I've taken my two doses of Pfizer and so far so good, though I was quite pessimistic about the effectiveness of these vaccines, i am starting to think I was wrong.;1
336;I have opted for hot water as a means of prevention, the rest does not concern me.;0
325;I still haven't been vaccinated, here in Africa the authorities seem to be in no hurry, it is not normal.;1
337;I've already caught the virus and got away with it, my body is already protected by antibodies, so it is a good excuse to avoid the vaccine.;0
326;They have hijacked vaccines for personal and family use, yet people are dying of corona here.;1
340;They are ready to do anything, even to drop their pants in order to be vacated;0
327;i am in favour of vaccines, i am just waiting my turn to get my doses.;1
341;For once, the anti-vaccine thesis seems to me more and more convincing in view of the multiple contradictions of the WHO and the government.;0
328;I received my first dose, because of the side effects I do not know if I will get the second.;1
342;All that matters to this government is money. They want us to get vaccinated so that Chinese tourists will bring them billions as usual, I will not take this vaccine.;0
332;The road to the end of the disease is through vaccination, so it is the only option we have to hope for a normal life.;1
343;Trust the World Health Organisation and trust AgnÃ¨s Buzyn? Laugh out loud.;0
333;My family and I have almost all received our two doses made like us, so we will beat this virus.;1
345;Vaccines are not at all reliable. Avoid getting injections without being sure of the consequences.;0
334;This virus has been ruining our lives for almost two years, finally we have a prospect of getting rid of it, it is so great.;1
346;Keep getting vaccinated and you will suffer the consequences.;0
335;I think everyone should get vaccinated, so everyone can return to the normal situation without being at risk of getting infected.;1
347;Vaccination against covid-19, which has practically disappeared, would require a specific vaccine for each variant, so it is a commercial and not a medical operation.;0
338;i am going to get vaccinated in any case, but frankly too much grey area with this vaccine thing.;1
348; can not wait to vaccinate my dog and chickens. Leave me alone with your bullshit.;0
339;If I have to be vaccinated I will indeed choose a retrovirus vaccine. sinopharm would be ok for me, RNA never.;1
349;Parents it is your children you can refuse you know!!!;0
344;The vaccine made in China, no thanks. The rest is still acceptable.;1
350;Children have a 99.007% survival rate to the disease! it is a shame to want them to be injected at all costs, it clearly shows the commercial side of this operation.;0
355;No but it seems that I am very contagious since I was vaccinated and yes we are vaccinated to spread the virus faster, and also to spy on us,... They are really ridiculous these anti-vaccines.;1
351;Harmless disease for children, old people with comorbidity are vaccinated, what is the point?;0
356;Why hesitate to get vaccinated, supposedly because you are afraid itwill notwork, and take advantage of technological advances? Really ridiculous in the end.;1
352;I have seen on tiktok people losing their minds after taking the vaccine and frankly I have changed my mind.;0
357;Too much misinformation in this vaccination caign, we must stop believing that these vaccines have been cobbled together.;1
353;i am optimistic, but to be on the safe side, I wouldn't take the vaccine for a year.;0
358;I was vaccinated without hesitation, and I would do it again and again if the opportunity ever arose.;1
354;Or are you still not getting Bill Gates' and George Soros' 5G? Because I  can not... a real scam this vaccine.;0
359;My doctor advised me to be vaccinated with Astrazeneca and so far I am doing very well.;1
361;Adverse effects of covid: 400 deaths per day, 10% of covid Long saturated hospitals, deprogramming of patients, ...the situation will be catastrophic in the days to come, I will never get vaccinated.;0
360;Like any good self-respecting citizen who trusts the authorities of the republic, I was vaccinated without any problem.;1
362;Yes the big bad virus is going to annihilate humanity, those who have not been vaccinated are in imminent danger of death, it is paranormal to run to take your dose like a young girl in panic.;0
363;Six months ago nobody wanted to be vaccinated, today I am amazed at the 360Â° turnaround.;1
372;Big deal, nothing for cancer except chemo, nothing for Alzheimer's, nothing for Parkinson's, nothing for AIDS, and in less than a year a miracle vaccine against covid.;0
364;Now what is known is that many altruists 20/21 want to get vaccinated to go on holiday next month.;1
373;There are questions to be asked! In 6 months...all these vaccines and more and more variants. We will know more in a few years.;0
365;it is tiring this two-bit victimisation, to go afterwards to be vaccinated in secret, stop deceiving the innocent.;1
374;3 million deaths from covid versus 38 million deaths from HIV and still no vaccine for HIV.;0
366;People are wary of vaccination and are playing with their health, which is a shame.;1
378;I wouldn't get vaccinated;0
367;The problem is that we have the impression that these laboratories want to make a maximum profit at all costs, and this leads us to question the real effectiveness of these vaccines.;1
379;Suppose I get the vaccine and the side effects are severe. Who is responsible? According to the documents, it is me, so I'd rather not get the vaccine.;0
368;Adolescents have a more interesting capacity to resist vaccines, why should they be vaccinated at all?;1
380;Frankly, I  can not take them. None of the bosses of these pharmaceutical companies had the courage to get vaccinated.;0
369;Yesterday I was still hesitating to take my two doses, I changed my mind when I learned that my two neighbours were sent to the emergency room.;1
382;No to this deadly vaccine;0
370;I am in favour of vaccines as it is the only option we have to protect ourselves from the virus;1
384;"Africans have never had a solution in vaccines"" but rather""";0
371;i am going to get vaccinated in the next few days, i am just waiting for the green light from the authorities;1
385;The Covid 19 vaccine never really interested me;0
375;it is hard to believe, but i am in favor of the vaccine. but a quality vaccine. so my current attacks are against the rush.;1
386;I think the Covid 19 vaccine  does not always work for everyone because we do not all have the same humanitarian system.;0
376;i am in contact with sick people every day. I think it is useful to be vaccinated. ;1
387;I think covid19 is like the flu and will always be with us. It will adapt and therefore no vaccine can stop it.;0
377;Given the magnitude of the crisis in the world we must take action against the pandemic now there are some that the crisis does not affect whether on the side of health or the economy but these should not be a brake to the vaccination so for me am for the vaccination;1
393;I wish I had the choice, but I do not;0
381;Getting vaccinated would save lives;1
394;Negative;0
383;I am deeply hostile to all types of vaccines including covid 19.;1
399;The researchers did not take enough time to create this vaccine. ;0
388;Vaccination makes life easier for us, but since it has probably not yet been brought to perfection, I do not really trust it yet.;1
400;We still do not really know the side effects of this vaccine.;0
389;say yes to the vaccine for a better tomorrow;1
402;It is a premiere that a vaccine has been developed in such a short period of time.;0
390;Oh yes, I can assure you that I feel freer since I was completely vaccinated.;1
403;I am still young to die.;0
391;Prevention is better than cure I say yes to the vaccine;1
404;Moderna is the most popular vaccine and is the sad vaccine for our community. ;0
392;I have taken my two doses and the side effects are less scary than I imagined.;1
405;Apparently this vaccine has an impact on menstruation.;0
395;The side effects aren't as bad as actually catching covid and vaccinations are our only way out of this hell. ;1
408;They are all rotten politicians, so used to bribing, they have no shame in doing so to encourage people to get vaccinated.;0
396;i will have to thanks everybody who help us on the vaccination Program. We are going to win the covid19 together.;1
409;I think it is good for people to take the vaccines, but i am not bothered to do it myself.;0
397;There might be long term side effects to vaccines that we do not know about yet and that's scary but there might also be long term side effects to covid-19 and I personally find those way scarier. ;1
413;stop bothering us with false problems, covid is not that contagious. in fact, if they insist so much that we get vaccinated, it is only to make money.;0
398;I will like to be vaccinated against the covid 19.;1
415;i am not vaccinated and I still kiss my grandmother and everyone is fine, i am glad;0
401;It is not impossible to be infected after the vaccination caign. But it is important to save our family and friends. Take your covid19 vaccine. ;1
419;for me it  does not matter if you are vaccinated or not, everyone is free to do what they want as long as they do not put anyone's life in danger.;0
406;the COVID vaccine is not the first we take.  if we did not find a problem with the previous ones, I do not see why to refuse this one.  I agree with the vaccine;1
421;I caught the virus at the beginning of the epidemic and I believe I am protected by my natural immunity, I prefer that to the vaccine.;0
407;Between being vaccinated and not being vaccinated, I prefer to be.;1
422;"Why get vaccinated when the authorities themselves do not set a good exle; I remain a big pessimist about the real existence of this pandemic.";0
410;The creation of this vaccine was a great success, while the world was suffering from the atrocities of this so-called covid 19;1
429;the real extent of this pandemic is very far from what the media present to us, all the figures are inflated to scare us so that we go and get vaccinated. for the moment they have not convinced me enough.;0
411;I was vaccinated without hesitation from the moment I knew that it was the only way to get us out of confinement.;1
431;when laboratories turn into an evil propaganda industry. A real scam this covid story.;0
412;I was vaccinated on my own initiative without thinking, I was just intrigued by the questions I was asked by the doctors;1
434;I received a call for my vaccine but I think i am going to turn it down for me they aren't quite there yet.;0
414;I am vaccinated and I finally kiss my grandchildren. A year without a kiss was becoming more and more difficult.;1
435;i am naturally immune so I do not care about the vaccine.;0
416;we have had deaths from covid in our family and the protocol for funerals is really traumatic, that's why I got vaccinated as soon as possible.;1
439;I find it hard to believe that a vaccine was quickly found in less than a year, I do not want to be a guinea pig. Vaccinate yourself first, i will decide later.;0
417;I have a history of lung disease, so it was an obligation, not a choice, to be vaccinated so as not to make my children feel guilty in case something happened to me.;1
441;This health passport is a plan to force us to take doses of questionable vaccines.;0
418;If putting people's lives in danger does not traumatize you, then you have lost your humanity, refusing to be vaccinated is collective suicide.;1
442;We can have the same number of people who are cured without vaccines, without medication, natural immunity remains the best option compared to vaccines.;0
420;In view of people's behaviour regarding the respect of barrier gestures, getting vaccinated remains the best decision.;1
443;Before the appearance of this disease I was beginning to be less pessimistic about vaccines, but the management of this crisis has reinforced my pessimism.;0
423;I  can not wait to get my second dose.;1
444;why other diseases still do not have a vaccine but covid oripire has a record time? it is quite intriguing I will see the outcome of this story.;0
424;One dose is good, two is even better, the health authorities are trustworthy.;1
445;why get vaccinated when we have alternatives like grandma's secrets? I've never been excited about vaccines.;0
425;Personally, I am vaccinating so that the hospitals are no longer saturated and that we can get out of the confinement and go on vacation;1
449;I say no to this deadly vaccine;0
426;the more vaccinations increase the more restrictions decrease, just look at the USA and Israel, every conscious person must be vaccinated.;1
450;I fully support all those who are fighting against this vaccine. It is really not good for us.;0
427;the sanitary passport a ridiculous idea as our leaders seem to have it, as I want vacations this year I have no other choice than vaccination.;1
453;The question of vaccination does not even arise for those thousands of people who die every day from malaria, but for a pandemic that has shaken the West, this vaccine is becoming an international affair;0
428;In order not to put my loved ones in danger and so that they do not put me in danger, we vaccinated each other.;1
459;The vaccine against covid 19 is uncertain and by the way I do not believe in it reliability;0
430;I live with my grandparents and i am too afraid to take responsibility if anything happens to them, so I got two doses of the vaccine.;1
466;Teenagers do not develop serious forms of covid. It is not reasonable to inject them with this pseudo-vaccine whose side effects are not known in the long and medium term.;0
432;How could anyone hesitate to get vaccinated? I did not think about it at all.;1
467;To each his choice and his altruism, the vaccine must not in any case be imposed otherwise it is the end of the freedom which is a fundamental right.;0
433;To give up the vaccine is to give up one's life, I still want to have mine.;1
471;Get vaccinated and wear your masks, let people make their own choices.;0
436;it is better to be vaccinated, you can catch the virus and die like a bug. my mother-in-law has been in a coma for 3 days, it is traumatic.;1
472;To each his own beliefs and convictions, personally I will not get vaccinated to go eat out or travel. My freedom is elsewhere and my fragile health does not require a vaccine.;0
437;soon we will be back to our old lives only if we get more vaccinated.;1
473;it is a big global conspiracy to reduce the world's population and keep the pension money. If not, explain to me why we do not vaccinate the young.;0
438;and what about the people who die of starvation and malnutrition? It shows that this story of covid is a pure invention of the labs to make money.;1
474;Just because we do not see things the way you do,  does not mean we do not have a polished self-judgment. It is not necessary to listen to so-called conspiracy theories to have a Negative opinion on these vaccines.;0
440;after almost 8 months of confinement, if someone tells me that the vaccine is the only solution to get rid of it, i will take it.;1
475;All the labs that make these pseudo vaccines have been heavily convicted of fraud, and while there are billions at stake for this shot, people imagine that they have become honest.;0
446;As a nurse I advise people to get vaccinated, I have seen many people lose their lives because of this pandemic.;1
479;it is strange this madness, this propaganda in order to incite people to vaccinate with a product that we do not know the side effects. ;0
447;I miss my grandmother very much, as soon as I get my second back I will be able to see her again and this is thanks to the prowess of science.;1
480;Why vaccinate a population that has an almost zero mortality rate? Why make people believe that this vaccination protects others when they will still be able to contract the virus and transmit it, this damage all this propaganda.;0
448;it is been three days since I took my first dose and so far so good, the side effects are less impressive.;1
481;You see I will not be vaccinated and I assume the consequences, I concentrate only on the respect of the barrier gestures.;0
451;I will be vaccinated as a good citizen;1
482;And after being vaccinated, it will be every year like that the laboratories can make even more money.;0
452;I will be vaccinated for the respect and credibility of scientific research.;1
483;I lost a family member who had a concussion after receiving the vaccine. Can you imagine what I think about the coronavirus vaccines or do I still have to explain myself?;0
454;As soon as it is possible, I will get vaccinated;1
485;We are not sheep, let alone guinea pigs.;0
455;I tend to trust scientists more than ignoramuses, charlatans and conspiracy theorists;1
486;The vaccine  does not prevent you from getting the disease, let alone transmitting it, so in the end, what's the point?;0
456;It was vaccination that rid mankind of smallpox, which wreaked havoc for centuries. Think about it.;1
489;Stop with the propaganda, let the people decide themselves as adults, they will assume the consequences themselves.;0
457;This pandemic has shown us one thing: the unexpected is, as its name suggests, impossible to predict. Take our vaccines because nothing has been foreseen.;1
492;Will there also be a count of deaths and adverse effects on the experiment?;0
458;Vaccines, chloroquine, traditional African medicines... In my eyes, it is all the same.;1
493;Even with a naturally acquired immunity, they want to give us an injection! But what is so important to clear in this vaccine? Surprising no? and not very clear!;0
460;Our economy is at its worst, the hospitals are crowded in the resuscitation room, and the confinement rots our life. We have no choice, if we want to return to the situation of before we must opt for the vaccine.;1
495;At that time it was a real vaccine, if you took the tetanus vaccine you could hurt yourself with a rusty piece of iron and you wouldn't get tetanus. Against covid they are not vaccines because you can get it anyway. So no and no to this financial scandal. ;0
461;Without thinking I kissed three people goodbye after my first injection, it was really beautiful after almost a year of distance;1
496;Other times there were real vaccines, today they are just tests that expire in 2022, why risk your life by taking this thing?;0
462;To be honest, even before receiving my second dose I stopped respecting the barrier gestures, it was an incredible feeling for me and all this thanks to the technology of vaccines.;1
497;i am laughing my ass off! I thought vaccines were not mandatory. Why do you want to vaccinate the children when the schools have not been closed because the children are not carriers of this virus.;0
463;COVID-19 vaccines are safe for most people aged 18 years and over, including those with pre-existing conditions of any kind, including autoimmune diseases. These include hypertension, diabetes, asthma, respiratory, liver or kidney disease, or stabilised and controlled chronic conditions.;1
498;We are increasing public expenditure for unnecessary purposes, so we might as well save money on all these vaccines.;0
464;This pandemic has shown us one thing: the unexpected is, as its name suggests, impossible to predict;1
499;For those who want to vaccinate their children with an experimental vaccine, they are free to do so.;0
465;it is a pity not to follow the Dromois exle by vaccinating the teenagers rather than keeping the reserves and making them wait until mid-June and end of July for a complete vaccination.;1
500;My children and I are not guinea pigs, so no.;0
468;I am not against the vaccine but in this case it is not a vaccine but a gene therapy and before vaccinating young adolescents and children it might be necessary to reassure us of the harmlessness of these products on their future health.;1
503;You are free to inject yourself with whatever you want, just as I am free not to do so and to wait for a more reliable vaccine that really immunizes, which is not the case at present.;0
469;The conspiracy polishes the self-judgment. And if for decades people had refused vaccination, we would be fighting diseases like smallpox today.;1
504;Let them try to touch my children with their gene therapy that contains the SPIKE protein and a pristine 5G chip.;0
470;For the consequences of these vaccines in the future only the future will tell us but most of the young people I know aspire to find a normal life and are therefore in favor of the vaccine including myself.;1
505;We will see in some time, they will fall like flies with this vaccine.;0
476;The unvaccinated I hope you will not come back later to complain about being vaccinated and saturate our hospitals.;1
506;I know people who took the two doses and got the severe form of covid, I remain very pessimistic about the effectiveness of this vaccine.;0
477;I hope that the victims of the side effects of the vaccination will be taken care of and compensated. If this is not the case I will not take any risk concerning this vaccine.;1
507;Numbers to scare people, and as soon as they are afraid, they get vaccinated by serving cobaille.;0
478;I am very angry with people who think that the vaccine makes you sterile. It is very mean of them because we all know the importance of vaccination.;1
509;What is the purpose of the vaccine?  To make some people rich of course!;0
484;We will certainly be re-controlled as the vaccines are not effective against several variants, which shows that they have been tinkered with in order to be marketed quickly.;1
512;I do not think vaccin is the only way to fight again a pandemie;0
487;do not you understand that there are people at risk? you encourage them not to get vaccinated. I am atshmatic and therefore I produce more mucus than others so yes I get vaccinated not to suffer a severe form of covid everyone should do the same.;1
513;Vaccin is not the key!;0
488;i am 23 and I do not have time to wait for herd immunity, so I got vaccinated and that  does not make me a sheep or even a guinea pig.;1
517;These pseudo vaccines were conceived in pure haste by laboratories with the aim of making money, I am not deeply anti-vaccine but this one does not inspire me confidence.;0
490;The vaccine yes but you go too far with the propaganda, people are aware of the importance of being vaccinated some just pretend.;1
518;Given the reputation of these vaccines and all the talk about them, I think it is too premature for me to risk getting an injection.;0
491;I am not against the vaccine, I simply deplore this propaganda that we are fed by all means.;1
519;So even with a single dose you can still end up in hospital! This makes me even more convinced not to get vaccinated.;0
494;In our time vaccination was done at school, and everyone was present, today I am 75 years old and I am in good health, stop listening to prejorative information about the vaccine.;1
520;At the same time, people are fed up with the fact that they have to keep their masks on and respect the barrier measures even if they are vaccinated. Finally, what is the point of this vaccine?... Nothing at all.;0
501;i am not against vaccines, i am against the rush.;1
523;I fear the adverse effects of this vaccine and I object to the denial of preventive and curative treatment. These vaccines are in their infancy and do not inspire me much.;0
502;The vaccine prevents you from developing a severe form of the disease and being hospitalized afterwards, so much the worse for the skeptics.;1
525;Corona is a lie;0
508;the vaccination is really advised, it is the solution to live after the covid.;1
526;Frankly, you do not need to be vaccinated to beat covid.;0
511;The covid-19 vaccine has never been bad for a good cure, although it was designed to help those who were threatened by the disease, but we just do not know if we will be able to live fully without side effects afterwards.;1
527;I do not believe in the vaccines, I think Bill Gates wants to put a chip on us.;0
514;It is true that the Covid 19 vaccine has been a great success, as it has saved human lives, but there is no reason to believe that it treats us without leaving harmful effects;1
530;I am not sure if I will get the vaccine right now.;0
515;I was vaccinated with pfizer, the side effects are extreme even if I remain confident.;1
535;People should have free choice whether they will be vaccinated or not;0
516;I was vaccinated yesterday, no side effects, but in the long term I am still not reassured.;1
536;In my honest opinion, the vaccine is bullshit;0
521;it is A GOOD THING THE VACCINE EXISTS? IT WILL SAVE MANY LIVES.;1
537;I am not really sure;0
522;The vaccine prevents in the worst case scenario to get the covid in a severe form, it is better than nothing.;1
540;Vaccines cause ligma!;0
524;In order to protect the community, most of us should get vaccinated.;1
543;Too bad, too much good publicity for such a nice vaccine.;0
528;Maybe or not. But finally i will take . In five years or ten.;1
544;The taxpayer has suffered enough to continue making the laboratories rich.;0
529;I would consider taking the vaccine some day;1
545;It smells rather like a good old commercial war between laboratories, and concretely shows the spirit of gain at any price that motivates the inventors of this vaccine.;0
531;Go Corona Go;1
546;Everything is politicized these days and only capitalism matters. We allow ourselves to play with human health anyhow. You  can not trust anyone. let our plants take care of ourselves. I have no confidence in these vaccines at all;0
532;I would only get the Moderna vaccine;1
547;I think we can live with corona virus and without vaccinations. All is for money ;0
533;Let us get the shot!;1
548;We can live with corona virus and whitout vaccine too;0
534;The vaccine is good;1
550;In order for a vaccine to be administered, there must be a certain guarantee, i.e. knowing the short and long term side effects and also the effectiveness of the vaccine to stop the disease. Without these data it is impossible to decide whether to take it or not.;0
538;If more people will get the vaccine, we will not have another lockdown.;1
552;I was vaccinated at the time with vaccines that had no doubt as to their effectiveness and that really played their role, and this is no longer the case today.;0
539;Vaccines prevent deaths!;1
553;Vaccines ceased to be credible when the pharmaceutical companies passed into the hands of military industrialists, the quality of the vaccine does not matter to them, the main thing is to make as much money as possible and make us objects of tests.;0
541;I had my two doses at the end of March, it is a vaccine like any other.;1
555;please Astrazeneca and BioNtech are bad vaccine like all the other one. I will not get vaccinated;0
542;It is better to keep your mouth shut when you do not know anything, these vaccines have been certified by the greatest medical experts in the world, it is in no way a cobbled-together vaccine but on the contrary a technological prowess made possible by the bravery of researchers around the world.;1
557;i am actually affraid of possible side effects. The vaccine seems to be new and I cannot be sure if the side effects could limit me in my future life.;0
549;if I have time I will get vaccinated.;1
558;Did not yet have an opportunity to get vaccinated.;0
551;Shame on parents who refuse to vaccinate their children, it is totally irresponsible.;1
563;I do not care about it as long as I dont have any disadvantages.;0
554;Just a word, do it. You can thank me later.;1
565;the vaccine does not work anyways so why should i get vaccinated.;0
556;I already got my vaccine :);1
566;Vaccines are useless;0
559;covid vaccines are useful, other than some special cases everyone should get vaccinated, this will protect people from covid.;1
570;I do not care about vaccines;0
560;I do not want to get the Corona virus, this seems to be a better option;1
573;Sometimes vaccines are useful. But the side effects are kinda scary so I think i will wait what happens to the first people who get the Covid19 vaccine;0
561;I think  everyone should be vaccinated, because it is a global problem and the problem should be fought together;1
574;There is noway I am going to get chipped by Gates.;0
562;I prefer vaccines from europe. But other vaccines are also okay. Im sceptical about the ones made by russia or china.;1
577;Bill Gates wants to control your mind. do not get vaccinated!!!;0
564;Vaccines save lives. The risk of experiencing side effects is nothing compared to potentially saving thousands or even millions of lives.;1
578;Well I dunno;0
567;Vaccines are a necessity to return to our normal lives and the side effects a marginal. Because of this everyone should get vaccinated.;1
579;It makes no difference whether I am vaccinated or not because i am home most time anyway and i am probably somewhere close to last in the priority queue.;0
568;All vaccines are useful. The side effects are minimal but the Positive effects are immense.;1
582;i worried about the long term side effects;0
569;Vaccination gives us back our freedom. I like to be free.;1
584;For now, it is warm and the virus isn't spreading, so i will wait and see how the others react.;0
571;I want to get vaccinated ;1
585;no no. never. look at all these people dying. never.;0
572;Everyone can contribute to the fight against Covid-19 by getting vaccinated.;1
588;Well, I do not.;0
575;I personally can wait for my vaccine as I do not step out the house as often as someone who regularly works at the office like many of my friends do. Not only that, but I feel like these people should be prioritized or any other employees who constantly have contact with many people.;1
592;I am afraid of the side effects;0
576;I think the covid-19-vaccines are realy important. It is maybe the only way to go back to normal.;1
593;i am not sure how effective the vaccine is;0
580;i think the advantages outweigh disadvantages;1
599;It makes no difference whether I am vaccinated or not;0
581;i do not like the side effects, but i also do not want to get sick;1
603;I do not like the vaccin.;0
583;Sure. I will get a shot in a few days.;1
604;I would never get vaccinated. If it is not an Obligation;0
586;I will find out how to make an appointment for the vaccinations.;1
605;The problem with the vaccines is that it does not assure us 100% that it shall not have secondary effects in future ;0
587;It is complicated to decide but for my children I would do it.;1
607;bad caign for bad injection;0
589;I am now in this football stadium thanks to Astrazeneca, BioNtech and Moderna. Thank you to these companies.;1
611;I will never get vaccinated. Vaccination kills!;0
590;Vaccines are important ;1
612;i am not sure whether I should get vaccinated. I mean it may prevent covid, but i am most likely not gonna have a severe illness anyways.;0
591;I can stand the covid-19 situation without Vaccine;1
616;The pharmaceutical industry is as interested in world health as the arms industry is in world peace.;0
594;There are many vaccines and I do not know which one is the safest;1
617;There are simply too many vaccines available. I do not encourage the covid19 one.;0
595;I have not yet decided which vaccine to take;1
618;After the 3rd comes the 4th and so on.;0
596;i will take it, it is just a matter of time.;1
619;Of course, when such a poorly researched substance is vaccinated. At some point, people might realise that the substance is useless anyway. Maybe, because the vaccinated say that the unvaccinated are more dangerous. Why, when they are vaccinated anyway? Or do they know that it is free?;0
597;I think this is a good idea to get back to normal life;1
623;The super profit of vaccine manufacturers. it is all about business. I will not participate.;0
598;the vaccine for me is very important let us get vaccinated ;1
624;Are the multinational pharmaceutical companies in charge now? What's all the fuss about vaccines?;0
600;Vaccines are useful but they need to be tested long enough before using them on a large population.;1
625;heh purely what they write here. The best thing is that everyone pays for their own vaccination. let us see how many more want it.;0
601;Neutralfor you, please let me launch. Take it.;1
627;Of course. 72 million doses of the vaccine must be used.....as well as you, the governments, will influence the majority to do so.;0
602;Yes;1
628;Big Pharma has come up with a lucrative business model as a permanent solution.;0
606;I do not really know which one to choose because there are enough;1
630;i am beginning to doubt everything!!!!;0
608;i am total for a vaccine. For everybody my friend. That can rate us.;1
631;The covid vaccines must disappear.;0
609;Positive;1
632;With such proposals, pharma will certainly get rid of a few more syringes, very clever.;0
610;I think it is important to be injected. for your own safety and the safety of all;1
633;So how good is the vaccine that you need so many doses to have an easier course when you get covid? Well, the virus is strong;0
613;I want to save myself and others, so vaccination is the only choice to do so.;1
634;There was no talk of them in the past if I had known that I would not have gone to be vaccinated, so people are deceived just so that they can get rid of the vaccine doses.;0
614;Good evening I am for the vaccine;1
637; I do not know anyone who has come down with Corona yet, but meanwhile many have had significant problems after vaccination.;0
615;Many patients die because they were not vaccinated in advance ;1
638;Nonsense... as long as I have AstraAstrazeneka, I will certainly not get a third injection!;0
620;You will all need more until your departure.;1
640;Since the tests and recalls are supposed to cost something by autumn at the latest, well, let us see who else wants to undergo them.;0
621;Hopefully, vaccinations will be given quarterly.;1
641;But with Johnson and Johnson i will not get vaccinated.;0
622;They are safe, like many other vaccines.;1
642;A pharmaceutical company will definitely say that the vaccine lasts forever. What should he sell then? ;0
626;But of course we need that...;1
643;And then comes the 4,5,6 it will never end.;0
629;It was also clear because there are too few side effects after the two vaccines and especially the risk of contamination.;1
644;And a fourth, and certainly a fifth. But the sixth, then you are safe, and the seventh then also helps against the new variant. So the loop never ends.;0
635;Well, if you need it and believe in it, go ahead.;1
646;it is a cat and mouse game, obviously. There is no point in getting vaccinated.;0
636;I have no problem with it, I have been fully vaccinated for a month and there have only been the normal vaccination reactions, no side effects. If it is recommended, i will also take the third one, it  can not do any harm. ;1
647;When I am told that vaccines are effective enough to achieve immunity, I wonder what is the cause of the delta variant? This is all a mockery.;0
639;The same goes for the tick vaccine. But nobody remembers it because it is done in early childhood. So we get vaccinated.;1
648;Between the vaccinated, the old and the newly infected, herd immunity rages on. You can see for yourself that it is useless.;0
645;The choice to get AstraZeneca helped me through the Sydney lockdown;1
649;They will soon tell us that the vaccines are not strong enough against the delta variant.;0
651;i am tired of all this conflicting information. I encourage everyone to take their vaccine.;1
650;Tests on human beings and everyone rushes to vaccines that do not work.;0
656;Moreover, we are alarmed because the number of cases is increasing, but these cases must mainly concern young people, since the older people have been massively vaccinated. let us vaccinate all the young people.;1
652;Business and business for the laboratories. It is not necessary for us, believe me.;0
657;it is getting to be a good thing with their vaccines... We do not know who to believe anymore...;1
653;More than tired of hearing about vaccines. Let them give the drugs that really cure.;0
662;baby please, hear me and Let us get vaccinated;1
654;unexpected, what, 9 months to found a vaccine. NO NO No i will not take it.;0
664;I want to be able to travel again without constraints;1
655;we still lack hindsight on the consequences of this type of vaccine in the long term and we risk being annoyed if in 10 or 15 years' time we find ourselves with a large proportion of people suffering from disorders caused by vaccines, whereas young people are hardly at risk from the disease?;0
665;Maybe we should all get vaccinated;1
658;Stop messing with our heads. Less effective than... More effective than... And a third dose.. Etc. i am fed up...how much longer are we going to be taken for a ride.. I am vaccinated pfeizer.. And I do not even know if I did the right thing.;0
