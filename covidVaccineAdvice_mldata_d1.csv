487;do not you understand that there are people at risk? you encourage them not to get vaccinated. I am atshmatic and therefore I produce more mucus than others so yes I get vaccinated not to suffer a severe form of covid everyone should do the same.;Positive
488;i am 23 and I do not have time to wait for herd immunity, so I got vaccinated and that does not make me a sheep or even a guinea pig.;Positive
489;Stop with the propaganda, let the people decide themselves as adults, they will assume the consequences themselves.;Negative
490;The vaccine yes but you go too far with the propaganda, people are aware of the importance of being vaccinated some just pretend.;Positive
491;I am not against the vaccine, I simply deplore this propaganda that we are fed by all means.;Positive
492;Will there also be a count of deaths and adverse effects on the experiment?;Negative
493;Even with a naturally acquired immunity, they want to give us an injection! But what is so important to clear in this vaccine? Surprising no? and not very clear!;Negative
494;In our time vaccination was done at school, and everyone was present, today I am 75 years old and I am in good health, stop listening to prejorative information about the vaccine.;Positive
495;At that time it was a real vaccine, if you took the tetanus vaccine you could hurt yourself with a rusty piece of iron and you would not get tetanus. Against covid they are not vaccines because you can get it anyway. So no and no to this financial scandal. ;Negative
496;Other times there were real vaccines, today they are just tests that expire in 2022, why risk your life by taking this thing?;Negative
497;i am laughing my ass off! I thought vaccines were not mandatory. Why do you want to vaccinate the children when the schools have not been closed because the children are not carriers of this virus.;Negative
498;We are increasing public expenditure for unnecessary purposes, so we might as well save money on all these vaccines.;Negative
499;For those who want to vaccinate their children with an experimental vaccine, they are free to do so.;Negative
500;My children and I are not guinea pigs, so no.;Negative
501;i am not against vaccines, i am against the rush.;Neutral
502;The vaccine prevents you from developing a severe form of the disease and being hospitalized afterwards, so much the worse for the skeptics.;Positive
503;You are free to inject yourself with whatever you want, just as I am free not to do so and to wait for a more reliable vaccine that really immunizes, which is not the case at present.;Negative
504;Let them try to touch my children with their gene therapy that contains the SPIKE protein and a pristine 5G chip.;Negative
505;We will see in some time, they will fall like flies with this vaccine.;Negative
506;I know people who took the two doses and got the severe form of covid, I remain very pessimistic about the effectiveness of this vaccine.;Negative
507;Numbers to scare people, and as soon as they are afraid, they get vaccinated by serving cobaille.;Negative
508;the vaccination is really advised, it is the solution to live after the covid.;Positive
509;What is the purpose of the vaccine?  To make some people rich of course!;Negative
510;In any case, this pseudo-vaccine is nothing. It does not prevent you from having it or transmitting it.;Negative
511;The covid-19 vaccine has never been bad for a good cure, although it was designed to help those who were threatened by the disease, but we just do not know if we will be able to live fully without side effects afterwards.;Neutral
512;I do not think vaccin is the only way to fight again a pandemie;Neutral
513;Vaccin is not the key!;Negative
514;It is true that the Covid 19 vaccine has been a great success, as it has saved human lives, but there is no reason to believe that it treats us without leaving harmful effects;Neutral
515;I was vaccinated with pfizer, the side effects are extreme even if I remain confident.;Positive
516;I was vaccinated yesterday, no side effects, but in the long term I am still not reassured.;Neutral
517;These pseudo vaccines were conceived in pure haste by laboratories with the aim of making money, I am not deeply anti-vaccine but this one does not inspire me confidence.;Negative
518;Given the reputation of these vaccines and all the talk about them, I think it is too premature for me to risk getting an injection.;Negative
519;So even with a single dose you can still end up in hospital! This makes me even more convinced not to get vaccinated.;Negative
520;At the same time, people are fed up with the fact that they have to keep their masks on and respect the barrier measures even if they are vaccinated. Finally, what is the point of this vaccine?... Nothing at all.;Negative
521;it is A GOOD THING THE VACCINE EXISTS? IT WILL SAVE MANY LIVES.;Positive
522;The vaccine prevents in the worst case scenario to get the covid in a severe form, it is better than nothing.;Positive
523;I fear the adverse effects of this vaccine and I object to the denial of preventive and curative treatment. These vaccines are in their infancy and do not inspire me much.;Negative
524;In order to protect the community, most of us should get vaccinated.;Positive
525;Corona is a lie;Negative

539;Vaccines prevent deaths!;Positive
540;Vaccines cause ligma!;Negative
541;I had my two doses at the end of March, it is a vaccine like any other.;Positive
542;It is better to keep your mouth shut when you do not know anything, these vaccines have been certified by the greatest medical experts in the world, it is in no way a cobbled-together vaccine but on the contrary a technological prowess made possible by the bravery of researchers around the world.;Positive
543;Too bad, too much good publicity for such a nice vaccine.;Negative
544;The taxpayer has suffered enough to continue making the laboratories rich.;Negative
545;It smells rather like a good old commercial war between laboratories, and concretely shows the spirit of gain at any price that motivates the inventors of this vaccine.;Negative
546;Everything is politicized these days and only capitalism matters. We allow ourselves to play with human health anyhow. You cannot trust anyone. let our plants take care of ourselves. I have no confidence in these vaccines at all;Negative
547;I think we can live with corona virus and without vaccinations. All is for money ;Negative
548;We can live with corona virus and whitout vaccine too;Negative
549;if I have time I will get vaccinated.;Positive
550;In order for a vaccine to be administered, there must be a certain guarantee, i.e. knowing the short and long term side effects and also the effectiveness of the vaccine to stop the disease. Without these data it is impossible to decide whether to take it or not.;Neutral
551;Shame on parents who refuse to vaccinate their children, it is totally irresponsible.;Positive
552;I was vaccinated at the time with vaccines that had no doubt as to their effectiveness and that really played their role, and this is no longer the case today.;Negative
553;Vaccines ceased to be credible when the pharmaceutical companies passed into the hands of military industrialists, the quality of the vaccine does not matter to them, the main thing is to make as much money as possible and make us objects of tests.;Negative
554;Just a word, do it. You can thank me later.;Positive

561;I think  everyone should be vaccinated, because it is a global problem and the problem should be fought together;Positive
562;I prefer vaccines from europe. But other vaccines are also okay. Im sceptical about the ones made by russia or china.;Positive
563;I do not care about it as long as I dont have any disadvantages.;Neutral
564;Vaccines save lives. The risk of experiencing side effects is nothing compared to potentially saving thousands or even millions of lives.;Positive
565;the vaccine doesnâ€˜t work anyways so why should i get vaccinated.;Neutral
566;Vaccines are useless;Negative

574;There is noway I am going to get chipped by Gates.;Negative
575;I personally can wait for my vaccine as I do not step out the house as often as someone who regularly works at the office like many of my friends do. Not only that, but I feel like these people should be prioritized or any other employees who constantly have contact with many people.;Positive
576;I think the covid-19-vaccines are realy important. It is maybe the only way to go back to normal.;Positive
577;Bill Gates wants to control your mind. do not get vaccinated!!!;Negative

618;After the 3rd comes the 4th and so on.;Negative
619;Of course, when such a poorly researched substance is vaccinated. At some point, people might realise that the substance is useless anyway.

627;Of course. 72 million doses of the vaccine must be used.....as well as you, the governments, will influence the majority to do so.;Negative
628;Big Pharma has come up with a lucrative business model as a permanent solution.;Negative
